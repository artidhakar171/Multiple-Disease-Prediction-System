# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction System project! This application utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on input medical data. It leverages advanced classification techniques to achieve high accuracy and provides insights into potential health risks.

Dataset Information
The objective of this task is to predict multiple diseases based on medical data. Given a dataset containing patient information, such as symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic results, the task is to classify which diseases the patient may be at risk for.

Formally, given a training sample of patient data and labels, where each label corresponds to the presence or absence of a specific disease, your objective is to predict the disease labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset containing medical data, which may include patient demographics, symptoms, and medical conditions.
